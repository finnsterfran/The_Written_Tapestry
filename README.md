### This database contains 3 collections of data:

1. category lends itself as the field 'category_name' in the stories collection.
    * when user creates a story, they select a category_name out of the category collection
2. users lends itself as a field titled 'author' in stories
    * user has to log in when creating a story
    * when user creates a story, session user is automatically recorded as the author when creating a new story
