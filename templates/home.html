                <blockquote>"Short stories are tiny windows into other worlds and other minds and other dreams.
                    They are journeys you can make to the farside of the universe and still be back in time for dinner." - Neil Gaiman</blockquote>
                <p>Short stories are self-contained works of prose fiction whose function is to impart a moral, capture a moment, 
                    or evoke a certain mood. Short stories are often more focused, as all the elements within - plot, character, pacing, 
                    story structure, and so on - must work together towards this common goal.
